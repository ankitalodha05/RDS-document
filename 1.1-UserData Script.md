# Automated MySQL 8.0 Installation on EC2 Using UserData Script

## Introduction

This document provides a UserData script that automates the installation and configuration of MySQL 8.0 on an Amazon EC2 instance. When used during instance creation, this script ensures MySQL is installed, configured, and ready for use without manual intervention.

---

## UserData Script

This script is designed for Amazon Linux 2023, Amazon Linux 2, or CentOS-based instances.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Updating system packages
dnf update -y

# Downloading and installing MySQL Yum repository
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el9-4.noarch.rpm
dnf install mysql80-community-release-el9-4.noarch.rpm -y

# Installing MySQL 8.0
dnf install mysql-community-server -y

# Starting and enabling MySQL service
systemctl start mysqld
systemctl enable mysqld

# Retrieving the default root password from logs
DEFAULT_PASSWORD=$(grep 'password' /var/log/mysqld.log | awk '{print $NF}')

# Setting up a new MySQL root password
NEW_PASSWORD="MySecurePassword123!"  # Change this to a strong password
echo "ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$NEW_PASSWORD';" > /tmp/mysql_init.sql

# Logging into MySQL using the default password and setting the new password
mysql --connect-expired-password -u root -p"$DEFAULT_PASSWORD" < /tmp/mysql_init.sql

# Cleaning up the temporary SQL file
rm -f /tmp/mysql_init.sql

# Display MySQL version and status
mysql -V
systemctl status mysqld
```

## How to Use This Script?

1. **Launch a new EC2 instance** from the AWS Management Console.
2. In the **Advanced Details** section, locate the **User data** field.
3. **Paste** the above script into the **User data** field.
4. Select **Amazon Linux 2023 / Amazon Linux 2 / CentOS** as the instance OS.
5. Configure security groups to allow **MySQL (port 3306)** if needed.
6. Click **Launch** and wait for the instance to initialize.

## What This Script Does?

✔ Updates system packages  
✔ Installs **MySQL 8.0**  
✔ Starts and enables **MySQL service**  
✔ Retrieves **default root password**  
✔ Sets a **new secure root password** (`MySecurePassword123!`)  
✔ Displays MySQL **version and status**  

---

## Post-Launch MySQL Access

After the instance has launched successfully, you can log in to MySQL using:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Enter the new password (`MySecurePassword123!` or your chosen password) when prompted.

---

## Notes:

- Change `MySecurePassword123!` to a strong password of your choice.
- Ensure **port 3306** is open in security groups if you need remote access.
- You can modify the script to add custom MySQL configurations as needed.

This script automates the entire MySQL setup, making it ideal for quick and consistent deployments of MySQL on AWS EC2 instances.

## Conclusion

By using this UserData script, you can streamline MySQL installations on EC2 instances, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent configurations.
